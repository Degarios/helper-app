### Helper-App: Bridging Communities, One Click at a Time

Introducing **Helper-App**, a thoughtfully designed platform that connects those in need with generous helpers within their community. This project showcases the power of **React Native**, combined with modern **React Hooks** and essential libraries, to deliver a seamless user experience. 

Built with **Google Maps** for real-time location tracking and enriched with mock data, **Helper-App** provides a simple yet engaging UI/UX that brings the concept of community support to life.

**Key Features:**

- **React Native & Hooks**: Efficient state management and responsive design for a smooth and dynamic user experience.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Allows users to locate and offer help within their community with precision and ease.
- **Mock Data**: Pre-filled with sample data to illustrate the appâ€™s core functionality and potential.
- **Accessible Entry**: Use `admin@admin.com` as the email and `admin` as the password to explore the app.

With **Helper-App**, the goal is to create a supportive network where help is just a click away. Whether you're interested in community-driven projects, or just want to explore the intersection of technology and social good, this project offers a valuable learning experience and a vision for how tech can bring people together.
